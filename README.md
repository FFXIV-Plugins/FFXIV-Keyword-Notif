Create a new APP, turn on the "Incoming Webhooks", activate, and then "Add New Webhook to Workspace", you will get an URL such as `https://hooks.slack.com/services/ABC/DEF/GHIJKLMN`, and `text` as the data key name. Set this as plugin webhook notification, when the keywords show up, the slack app you just created will send you a message.
